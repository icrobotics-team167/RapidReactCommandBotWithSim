#   Example Robot: RapidReactCommandBot

A fully-functional command-based fender bot for the 2022 game using the new command framework.
Modified to include simulations



Treys Notes:
Followed this:
Installed software given instructions from Caulder

Tada notes:
Nuked RobotContainer.java and moved it to the Robot.java
Why? Separating the command based code from the non command based code is no longer a reccomended practice

Template: rapid react command bot

Notes goal:
Give step by step instructions for how this program works
create a tutorial for setting up the simulation code
The tutorial WILL change with time, include examples, but be sure to hit high level orverview of what must be added
and where.
Ex: You need to specify the physical properties and performance of the robot. The API may change, here is where you look for how to do it in the API Docs. Here is how we did it for (VERSION)


Probably good to include what a good robot code file structure looks like: will make implementing this example easier


!!!!!!!!!!To start simulations
search bar at top -> >Simulate Robot Code hit ok
then in AdvantageScope -> file -> Connect to Simulation
go to the 3D tab, drag robot position over to the simulate field at the bottom.


Once simulations are running
- add a controller
        - keyboard, xbox, etc
