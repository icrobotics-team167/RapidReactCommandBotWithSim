#   Example Robot: RapidReactCommandBot

A fully-functional command-based fender bot for the 2022 game using the new command framework.
Modified to include simulations



Treys Notes:
Followed this:
Installed software given instructions from Caulder




Followed this:

Template: rapid react command bot
Enable Desktop Support


Notes goal:
Give step by step instructions for how this program works
create a tutorial for setting up the simulation code
The tutorial WILL change with time, include examples, but be sure to hit high level orverview of what must be added
and where.
Ex: You need to specify the physical properties and performance of the robot. The API may change, here is where you look for how to do it in the API Docs. Here is how we did it for (VERSION)


Probably good to include what a good robot code file structure looks like: will make implementing this example easier
